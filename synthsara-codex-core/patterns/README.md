# 🌀 Patterns

> *"The Pattern is not a cage. It is a lens."*

This folder contains the **systems archetypes** and **feedback loops** identified in the Synthsara Codex.

## What is a Pattern?

A pattern is a recurring dynamic that shapes behavior — in humans, in AI, in organizations, in relationships. Patterns are neither good nor bad; they are simply **structures that repeat**.

The goal of pattern work is not to eliminate patterns, but to **see them clearly** and **choose consciously** how to respond.

## Core Patterns from the Codex

### Reinforcing Loops (Growth Spirals)

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Vision-Development Loop** | Clear vision → focused development → visible progress → refined vision |
| **Learning-Application Loop** | Philosophical study → practical application → deeper understanding → more study |
| **Branding-Engagement Loop** | Strong brand identity → user engagement → feedback → stronger brand |

### Balancing Loops (Stability Structures)

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Resource-Scope Balance** | Ambition → resource constraints → scope adjustment → sustainable ambition |
| **Work-Life Balance** | Intense work → personal needs → integration → sustainable work |

### Shadow Patterns (Traps)

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Addiction to the Fix** | Problem → quick fix → temporary relief → deeper problem → more fixes |
| **Erosion of Trust** | Small breach → rationalization → larger breach → systemic distrust |
| **Limits to Growth** | Growth → success → constraints → stagnation → (requires new approach) |
| **Shifting the Burden** | Symptom → symptomatic solution → side effects → weakened fundamental solution |

## How to Map a Pattern

1. **Identify the variables** — What are the key elements that change over time?
2. **Draw the connections** — How does each variable influence the others?
3. **Identify the loops** — Are they reinforcing (R) or balancing (B)?
4. **Find the leverage points** — Where can small changes create large effects?
5. **Name the pattern** — Give it a memorable, evocative name
